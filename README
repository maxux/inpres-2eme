inpres-2eme git repository
==========================

	Please note that this repository contains lot of *bad* code.
	It's beyond my control. Some teachers force us to produce bad code just for "learn" how "it works"
	I disagree with this point of view, a lot of code doesn't respect teachers rules but I cannot do this
	for all of my codes, if I want to quit school one day...

	Have fun reading shit code :)
